# GoodMorning!

## Description
This project requires several Python packages to function correctly. These packages enable functionalities such as working with APIs, accessing iCloud, geolocation services, and more.
Additionally, there are specific comments contained within in-line comments surrounding relevant code. Code will not run out-of-the box. Details and information are required for it to work properly including: Appropriate API keys, relevant packages installed, potentially iCloud login-info.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You also need to install the required Python packages listed below.

## Required Packages

The code depends on the following Python libraries:

- `openai`: For integrating OpenAI's API.
- `requests`: For making HTTP requests.
- `pyicloud`: For accessing iCloud services.
- `geopy`: For geocoding and working with geographical data.
- `keyring`: For secure storage of credentials.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.7 or higher).

2. Install the required packages using `pip`. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install openai requests pyicloud geopy keyring
   ```

3. Verify all packages are installed correctly by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip list
   ```

   This will display a list of installed packages.

## API Keys

The following API keys are required for the project to function correctly:

- **OpenAI API Key**: Obtain your own via [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). Note: Your account must be authorized to access models even if you have your own key (key: free; access: paid).
- **OpenWeatherMap API Key**: Obtain your key through [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).
- **Gmail App Password**: The code is configured for Gmail. You need an app password to allow access. Obtain it via [Google App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).

## Usage

Once all dependencies are installed, you can run the code as intended. Make sure to set up any required API keys, environment variables, or credentials for services like OpenAI, iCloud, or SMTP.

## Notes

- For `pyicloud`, ensure your iCloud account is set up and that you have access credentials ready.
- For `keyring`, ensure your system supports a secure storage backend.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Double-check that Python and pip are installed and added to your system PATH.
2. Verify that you installed the correct versions of the required packages.
3. Check for typos in your code or installation commands.
4. Ensure any required credentials or API keys are correctly set up.
